<h1>Simple Password Generator in Python</h1>

<p>With this simple code you can generate randomized passwords for everything you might need, I tried emulating and simplifying what a password manager does as an exercise. Code is kept simple and should be able to be easily integrated with another application if you so like to.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Simple password generator running directly from the terminal</li>
  <li>Exception raises if you attempt to generate a password less than 16 characters long, can be manually adjusted in try/except block</li>
  <li>Exception class can be customized for your personal use-case</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you like this simple exercise, I encourage you to either replicate it or take this code and improve on it</h3>
